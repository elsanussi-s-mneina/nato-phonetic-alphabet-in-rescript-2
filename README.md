# NATO Phonetic Alphabet (programmed using ReScript and React)

This converts text like "ab" into "Alpha Bravo". 

This project is mainly intended as an exercise for showing a simple application with text input and text output. I have implemented it in this repository in Rescript.

I also sometimes implement the same project in other programming languages.


# Prerequisites:
1. Node (for running Javascript)
2. Snowpack (for bundling files)
You can install it locally with the following command:

`npm install --save-dev snowpack`

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

(Note: I had to refresh the web page the first time I ran npm start, but subsequent times worked immediately.)

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### npm test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.
